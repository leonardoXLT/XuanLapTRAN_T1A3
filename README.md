# T1A3 - PROJECT: TERMINAL APPLICATION

# MemPal: A Python Terminal App for Creating and Editing Memory Palaces

### Introduction

MemPal is a terminal application that allows users to create and manage their own memory palaces. A memory palace is a mnemonic technique that involves associating information with specific locations in a familiar environment. This app is created based on this memory technique to assist with creating, editing and reviewing Memory Palace to improve user memory and learning capacity.

MemPal also includes a mini game that tests the user’s ability to recall items in the memory palaces.

MemPal is written in Python and runs on the command line. It accepts user input in the form of text and produces printed output or interacts with the file system.

## Slide Deck

The slide deck contains:
- A walk-through of the terminal application, its features and how it is used
- A walk-through of the logic of the terminal application and code
- A review of the development/build process including challenges, ethical issues, favourite parts, etc.

## Code Style Guide or Styling Conventions

The code style guide or styling conventions that MemPal adheres to are based on the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.

DRY Principle

# Features and Functionalities

MemPal has the following features and functionalities:

1. Create a memory palace: The user can enter the name and description of a memory palace, and then add loci and its number order. The user can also edit or delete existing memory palaces.

2. View memory palaces: The user can view a list of all their memory palaces, sorted by the scores they achieved in the mini game. The user can also view the details of each memory palace, such as the name, description, loci, and its number order.

3. Play the mini game: The user can select a memory palace and play a mini game that randomly quizzes them on the items associated with each loci. The user will get points for correct answers. The user’s score will be saved and used to sort the memory palaces.

## **Implementation Plan**

Use Trello board


### Usage of a Trello platform

#### 15 - 18/12/2023

- Most of my time was spent on reviewing python, doing some python practice and trying to catch/generate as many ideas as possible.

- I've done some research on google too to see some of the common interesting ideas.

- Created Trello account, then created a board using a simple template.

- Created a simple Readme framework to follow/update

- Created a simple Implementation plan to follow/update

- Got idea approved on Monday 18/12/2023
