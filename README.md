# MemPal: A Python Terminal App for Creating and Editing Memory Palaces

### Introduction

MemPal is a terminal application that allows users to create and manage their own memory palaces. A memory palace is a mnemonic technique that involves associating information with specific locations in a familiar environment. This app is created based on this memory technique to assist with creating, editing and reviewing Memory Palace to improve user memory and learning capacity.

MemPal also includes a mini game that tests the user’s ability to recall items in the memory palaces.

MemPal is written in Python and runs on the command line. It accepts user input in the form of text and produces printed output or interacts with the file system.
